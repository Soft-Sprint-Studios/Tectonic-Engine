# Credits

Huge thanks to the [Pathos Game Engine](https://github.com/TheOverfloater/pathos-public) for heavy inspiration - many engine entities have mainly been written by reading their code, along with some shader code like the black hole shader. 

Gratitude to the **Godot Engine** for their bicubic lightmaps code
