# Engine Configuration

The Tectonic Engine's behavior can be configured through several files and pre-processor definitions.

## `gameconf.txt`

This file, located in the root directory, controls the initial startup behavior of the engine.

*   `gamename`: Sets the name of your game, which is displayed in the main menu and Discord presence.
*   `startmap`: Defines the `.map` file that the engine will load by default when it starts.

## `compat.h`

This header file contains critical pre-processor definitions for compiling different versions of the engine.

*   `GAME_RELEASE`: Uncommenting this define will enable optimizations and disable certain debug features for a final build.
*   `ENABLE_CHECKSUM`: Enables the anti-tamper checksum verification on startup. It is recommended to keep this enabled for release builds.
*   `DISABLE_DEBUGGER`: When defined, the engine will check if a debugger is attached on startup and exit if one is found. This is a simple anti-debugging measure.

## `cvars.txt`

This file is automatically generated and contains all the console variables and their current values. While it can be edited manually, it's generally recommended to manage these settings through the in-game console.
