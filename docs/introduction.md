# Introduction to the Tectonic Engine

Welcome to the Tectonic Engine, a powerful, feature-rich 3D game engine developed by Soft Sprint Studios. Designed for flexibility and performance, Tectonic provides a complete suite of tools for creating immersive 3D experiences on Windows and Linux.

The engine is built with a modern, deferred rendering pipeline, a robust physics system powered by Bullet Physics, and an intuitive Input/Output system for complex entity interactions. Its core philosophy is to provide a hands-on, code-driven development experience, supplemented by a powerful real-time editor for level design and world-building.

## Core Principles

*   **Real-Time Editing:** A fully-featured, in-engine editor allows for rapid iteration on maps, lighting, and entity placement. What you see is what you get.
*   **Extensible Systems:** The engine's architecture, from console commands to material definitions, is designed to be easily extended.
*   **Performance:** With features like a deferred renderer, threaded DSP, and a focus on efficient systems, the engine is built to perform.
*   **Developer Focused:** Tectonic is for developers who want deep control over the engine's functionality, with transparent systems for materials, sound, physics, and game logic.

This documentation will guide you through the architecture, features, and workflows of the Tectonic Engine.
